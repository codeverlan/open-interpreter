# Open Interpreter Project Status

## READ FIRST

ALWAYS keep this file in your memory, refer to it frequently for context. Update it without being asked when a listed task is complete.
Add tasks to the file in the right section. If a significant period of time is spent resolving an error, list the attempts made to
resolve it.

- Frontend directory location: /root/open/interpreter/frontend
- Backend port number: 5159
- When the backend is started, start the frontend automatically
- Always check the terminal for output after every action requiring a terminal command
- The project root directory is /root/open

## Vision
The goal is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment, allowing users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis. We are now moving towards an agentic model to enhance automation and intelligence in the system. Each agent should be assigned its own AI model for more flexible and specialized interactions.

## Current Task
## Agent Hierarchy and Task Assignment
1. Project Level:
   - A project must be chosen
   - Each project can have multiple agents.
   - Agents within a project can collaborate on tasks.
   - Agents remain persistent until the task is verified as complete by the user
   
2. Agent Types:
   - Lead Agent: Decides what other agents are needed, assigns task, coodinates model behavior, takes feedback from other agents and organizes it to satisfy the user's question, interacts with the user. 
   - General-purpose agents: Can handle a wide range of tasks.
   - Specialized agents: Focused on specific domains or skills (e.g., code generation, data analysis, writing). Specialized agents have access to the internet to assist them with tasks.
3. Agent Hierarchy:
   3.1 Introduce a Mead Agent role that will be responsible for coordinating other agents and interacting with the user.
   Update the existing Agent class to support different agent roles, including the Master Agent.
   3.2 Modify the task assignment system to route all tasks through the Master Agent first.
   3.3 Implement decision-making logic for the Master Agent to analyze tasks and   delegate them to the appropriate gener or specialized agents.
   3.4 Inter-agent Communication:
      - Develop a communication protocol that allows the Master Agent to coordinate with other agents effectively.
   3.7 
   3.8 Pause and and ask the user for feedback
    4. Task Assignment Process:
   - When a user assigns a task:
     a. The system analyzes the task requirements.
     b. It selects the most appropriate agent(s) based on their capabilities and assigned models.
     c. If multiple agents are needed, it coordinates their efforts.
5. 3. Model Behavior:
   - Confirm that the Open Router integration is working
   - Apply the direct API integration with Anthropic
   - Test that prompt caching works with Anthropic API
   - The user assigns the model, if none is assigned the AI assigns it
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user

5. Agent Interaction:
   - Agents can communicate with each other to share information and subtasks
   - They can also request human intervention when needed.
   - When thier task is complete, all general and specialized agents report thier data to the master agent 
   - The Master Agent organizes the information into a useful response or contribution to satisfy the user's prompt
   - The user may assign a number of automated iterations for the agents to attempt. This temporarly renmoves the Human in the Middlle factor, and allows agents to continue to problem solve, even if they encouter an error.
   - At the end of the number of iterations, the Master Agent will report progress or challenges, as well as suggest the next step.
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
6. Template System:
   6.1 Create a System for Prompt Templates
   6.2 Prompt Template Model
   6.3 API Endpoints for Prompt Templates
   6.4 Frontend Integration
   6.5 Agent Interaction with Templates
   6.6 Pause and and ask the user for feedback
7. Prompt Management:
   - Agents use versioned prompts to guide their behavior and responses.
   - Prompts can be updated to refine agent capabilities without changing the underlying model.
   - The model integrates directions in this priority:
      a. Assigned task from the Master Agent
      b. User prompt
      c. Agent programing
      c. System Prompt
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
8. Knowledge Building:
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
   - Each agent builds and maintains its own knowledge base.
   - The knowledge base includes:
      a. Task history and outcomes
      b. User feedback and preferences
      c. Project-specific information
      d. Relevant domain knowledge
   - Agents can reference and update their knowledge base during task execution.
   - Knowledge bases are persistent across sessions, allowing for continuous learning and improvement.
4. Real Time Feedback
    4.1 Allow the Master Agent to critique its own performance and report it to the user.
    4.2 Extend the feedback and learning mechanisms to allow the Lead Agent to evaluate and optimize the performance of other agents.
    4.3 After the Master Agent reports to the user, the user is asked one open ended question about the Agent's performance.
    4.4 Create and test a mechanism for reccomending updates to agent behavior to the knowledge-base.
    4.5 Use built in API calls to display the overall cost of the project in real time.
    4.6 Pause and and ask the user for feedback
5. Test the Agentic System Functions
   5.1 Access and Modification Capabilities
   5.2 Agent Suggestions and User Interaction
   5.3 Delegating Agent Functionality
   5.4 Test Knowledge Base Integration and Persistence
   5.5 Pause and and ask the user for feedback
6. Update UX/UI
    6.1 Modify ChatInterface to support multi-agent interactions
    6.2 Create interface for viewing and managing agent hierarchies
    6.3 Implement visualization for task assignment and agent collaboration
    6.4 Develop user interface for providing feedback and viewing agent performance
