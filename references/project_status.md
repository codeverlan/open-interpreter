# Open Interpreter Project Status

## READ FIRST

ALWAYS keep this file in your memory, refer to it frequently for context. Update it without being asked when a listed task is complete.
Add tasks to the file in the right section. If a significant period of time is spent resolving an error, list the attempts made to
resolve it.

- Frontend directory location: /root/open/interpreter/frontend
- Backend port number: 5159
- When the backend is started, start the frontend automatically
- Always check the terminal for output after every action requiring a terminal command
- The project root directory is /root/open

## Vision

The goal is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment, allowing users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis. We are now moving towards an agentic model to enhance automation and intelligence in the system.

## Current Task

Implement an agentic model and enhance the overall system:

1. Design and Implement an Agent Class
   1.1 ✅ Create an Agent class with capabilities:

   - Automated prompt management
   - Intelligent project setup
   - Dynamic code assistance
   - Automated testing and debugging
   - Continuous learning from user feedback
     1.2 ✅ Integrate the Agent Class with the Backend
     1.3 ✅ Develop a Frontend Interface for Agent Management
     1.4 ✅ Implement Feedback Mechanism
2. Implement AI Integration
   2.1 Integrate OpenRouter for AI Model Selection
   2.2 Integrate Direct Anthropic API with Caching
   2.3 Seamless Model Switching
   2.4 Error Handling and Fallbacks
3. Implement Prompt Versioning
   3.1 Extend Prompt Model
   3.2 API Endpoints for Prompt Versions
   3.3 Frontend Integration
   3.4 Agent Access to Prompt Versions
4. Create a System for Prompt Templates
   4.1 Prompt Template Model
   4.2 API Endpoints for Prompt Templates
   4.3 Frontend Integration
   4.4 Agent Interaction with Templates
5. Test the Agentic System
   5.1 Access and Modification Capabilities
   5.2 Agent Suggestions and User Interaction
   5.3 Delegating Agent Functionality
6. Improve State Management
   6.1 Review State Management Practices
   6.2 Correct State Updates After API Calls
7. Performance Optimization
   7.1 Implement Caching Strategies
   7.2 Optimize Database Queries
   7.3 Optimize Agent Communication
8. Comprehensive Testing
   8.1 Develop Unit Tests
   8.2 Implement Integration Tests
   8.3 End-to-End Testing
   8.4 Continuous Integration
9. Documentation and User Guides
   9.1 Developer Documentation
   9.2 User Guides
10. Deployment and Release Preparation
    10.1 Deployment Setup
    10.2 Release Notes and Versioning

## GUI

1. ✅ Implemented AgentManager component with CRUD functionality
2. ✅ Created and styled AgentManager component
3. ✅ Implemented backend API endpoints for agent management in core.py
4. ✅ Added error handling and success notifications to the AgentManager component
5. ✅ Integrated AgentManager into the main App component
6. ✅ Created documentation for the AgentManager feature in docs/AgentManager.md
7. ✅ Updated the main README.md file to mention the AgentManager feature and its documentation
8. ✅ Implemented database integration for all components (agents, docs, outlines, prompts, terminal output, and settings)
9. ✅ Associated all components with their parent projects in the database
10. ✅ Updated API endpoints to use the database for persistent storage
11. ✅ Tested and verified all API endpoints are working correctly with database integration

Next steps:
- Commit changes to version control
- Inform the team about the new database integration and updated API endpoints
- Consider creating tasks for future enhancements (pagination, search functionality, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Begin implementing the Agent class as described in section 1.
2. ✅ Set up the necessary backend infrastructure to support the Agent class.
3. ✅ Start developing the frontend interface for Agent management.
4. ✅ Remove the code tab and its associated functionality from the frontend.
5. ✅ Implement the Feedback Mechanism for Agents:
   - Add a feedback form to the AgentManager component
   - Create an API endpoint for submitting feedback
   - Update the Agent class to store and process feedback
6. ✅ Test the Agent Management functionality:
   - Create, read, update, and delete agents through the frontend
   - Verify that agents are correctly stored in the database
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Test the feedback submission and storage
7. Begin work on AI Integration:
   - Research OpenRouter API and its integration requirements
   - Start implementing OpenRouter integration in the backend
8. Implement Prompt Versioning:
   - Extend the Prompt model to include version information
   - Create API endpoints for managing prompt versions
   - Update the frontend to support prompt versioning

This file will be updated as we make progress on implementing the agentic model and improving the overall functionality of the application.
