ALWAYS keep this file in your memory, refer to it frequently for context. Update it without being asked when a listed task is complete.
Add tasks to the file in the right section. If a significant period of time is spent resolving an error, list the attempts made to
resolve it.

- Frontend directory location: /root/open/interpreter/frontend
- Backend port number: 5159
- When the backend is started, start the frontend automatically
- Always check the terminal for output after every action requiring a terminal command
- The project root directory is /root/open

## Vision

The goal is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment, allowing users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis. We are now moving towards an agentic model to enhance automation and intelligence in the system. Each agent should be assigned its own AI model for more flexible and specialized interactions.

## Agent Hierarchy and Task Assignment

1. Project Level:
   - Each project can have multiple agents.
   - Agents within a project can collaborate on tasks.

2. Agent Types:
   - Pause: Discuss integrating internet access with the user
   - General-purpose agents: Can handle a wide range of tasks.
   - Specialized agents: Focused on specific domains or skills (e.g., code generation, data analysis, writing).

3. Model Assignment:
   - ✅ Each agent is assigned a specific AI model (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4).
   - ✅ Users can set and change the assigned model for each agent.
   - The assigned model determines the agent's capabilities and performance.

4. Task Assignment Process:
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
   - When a user assigns a task:
     a. The system analyzes the task requirements.
     b. It selects the most appropriate agent(s) based on their capabilities and assigned models.
     c. If multiple agents are needed, it coordinates their efforts.

5. Agent Interaction:
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
   - Agents can communicate with each other to share information and subtasks.
   - They can also request human intervention when needed.

6. Learning and Improvement:
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
   - Agents can learn from feedback and improve their performance over time.
   - The system can suggest optimizations in agent assignments based on past performance.

7. Prompt Management:
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
   - Agents use versioned prompts to guide their behavior and responses.
   - Prompts can be updated to refine agent capabilities without changing the underlying model.

8. Knowledge Building:
   - Pause: Discuss progress with the user
   - Each agent builds and maintains its own knowledge base.
   - The knowledge base includes:
     a. Task history and outcomes
     b. User feedback and preferences
     c. Project-specific information
     d. Relevant domain knowledge
   - Agents can reference and update their knowledge base during task execution.
   - Knowledge bases are persistent across sessions, allowing for continuous learning and improvement.
