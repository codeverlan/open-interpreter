## READ FIRST

ALWAYS keep this file in your memory, refer to it frequently for context. Update it without being asked when a listed task is complete.
Add tasks to the file in the right section. If a significant period of time is spent resolving an error, list the attempts made to
resolve it.

- Frontend directory location: /root/open/interpreter/frontend

## Vision
The goal is to create a Frontend with a modular, project-based environment, allowing users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis. We are now moving towards an agentic model to enhance automation and intelligence of the system.
Agents persist between tasks, share knowledge and self improve.
