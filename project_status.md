# Open Interpreter Project Status

## Vision
The goal in modifying this program is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment. This allows users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis, primarily intended for open-source software. Our modifications prioritize the ability to reference specific documentation and customize prompts for each project. The program adheres to programming best practices rather than being creative.

### Completed Features

   - DocumentationViewer:
     - Implemented viewing and editing of project-specific documentation
     - Added support for multiple documentation files per project
     - Implemented markdown rendering for documentation content
   - ProjectAnalyzer:
     - Created component for triggering project analysis
     - Implemented display of project analysis results

5. API Integration:
   - Integrated all components with corresponding API endpoints
   - Implemented retry mechanisms and debounce functions for API calls

6. Error Handling:
   - Improved error handling across all frontend components
   - Implemented consistent error reporting to users
   - Enhanced backend error handling with custom exceptions and API-level error management

7. Project-based Configuration:
   - Implemented system for storing and loading project-specific settings
   - Modified SettingsPanel to handle project-specific configurations
   - Updated ExtendedInterpreter to use project-specific settings

8. Documentation Integration:
   - Implemented a system for linking and storing project-specific documentation
   - Created a new component (DocumentationViewer) for displaying and editing project documentation

9. Customizable Prompts:
   - Implemented system for storing and managing project-specific prompts
   - Added UI for editing custom prompts in the SettingsPanel
   - Updated ExtendedInterpreter to use project-specific prompts

10. Non-Creative Approach:
    - Adjusted default settings to prioritize best practices over creativity
    - Moved creative-related parameters (temperature, top_p) to environment variables
    - Updated prompts to focus on standard practices and conventions

11. Project Analysis:
    - Implemented ProjectAnalyzer class for analyzing project structure and metrics
    - Added API endpoint for triggering project analysis
    - Created frontend component (ProjectAnalyzer) for displaying analysis results

### In Progress

1. Testing Strategy:
   - Developing a comprehensive testing strategy for all features

2. Documentation:
   - Updating documentation to reflect new features and improvements

## Next Steps

1. Develop and Implement Testing Strategy:
   - Create unit tests for individual components (frontend and backend)
   - Implement integration tests for API and frontend interactions
   - Set up end-to-end testing for critical user flows

2. Update Documentation:
   - Document new features and web interface usage
   - Update README with web interface instructions and setup process
   - Create user guide for the enhanced Open Interpreter
   - Document the non-creative approach and how to configure environment variables

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Conduct performance audits on both frontend and backend
   - Optimize API calls and data loading strategies
   - Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate

4. Security Enhancements:
   - Conduct security audit of the application
   - Implement additional security measures (e.g., input sanitization, CSRF protection)

5. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Conduct accessibility audit
   - Implement improvements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

6. Internationalization:
   - Prepare the application for internationalization
   - Implement language selection feature

7. Conduct User Testing:
