# Open Interpreter Project Status

## Vision
The goal in modifying this program is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment. This allows users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis, primarily intended for open-source software. Our modifications prioritize the ability to reference specific documentation and customize prompts for each project. The program adheres to programming best practices rather than being creative.

## Current Task

Implement API calls in the PromptManager component:

1. ✅ Update the PromptManager.js file to include functions for making API calls to our backend endpoints.
2. ✅ Integrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with the component's UI.
3. ✅ Implement error handling for API calls.
4. ✅ Add loading states.
5. ✅ Test the implemented API calls:
   - Manually tested each CRUD operation to ensure it works as expected.
   - Verified that error handling works correctly for various error scenarios.
   - Checked that loading states are displayed appropriately during API calls.
6. Implement actual functionality for `get_settings` and `get_projects` methods:
   - Update the OpenInterpreter class to include real implementations of these methods.
   - Ensure these methods interact correctly with the database and return appropriate data.
7. Refine and optimize:
   - Review the implemented code for any potential improvements or optimizations.
   - Ensure that the component efficiently manages state related to prompts and API call status.
8. Update documentation:
   - Add comments to the PromptManager.js file explaining the API call functions and their usage.
   - Update any relevant documentation about the PromptManager component to reflect the new API integration.

## Previous Tasks (Completed or In Progress)

1. Implement project-based prompt management:
   - ✅ Extend the data model to include prompts associated with projects.
   - ✅ Develop API endpoints for CRUD operations on prompts.
   - ✅ Create frontend components for managing prompts within projects.
   - ✅ Integrate prompt management with existing project functionality.

2. Redesign UI to follow best practices. 
   - Use a series of tabs across the top of the interface. 
   - Disable or delete the save snippets function.
   - Consider which elements belong on which tabs for optimal user experience. 
   - Redesign the preferences screen and give it its own tab. 
   - Enhance the knowledgebase feature to upload single files and reference entire directories. 
   - Implement add/delete functionality for projects, prompting for project directory and associated conda environment. The con

3. Address API Endpoint Mismatches:
   - ✅ Resolve 404 errors for:
     - GET /api/get_settings/get_settings
     - GET /api/get_settings/get_projects

4. Test the integration of the PromptManager component:
   - ✅ Run the application and ensure that the PromptManager component appears when a project is selected.
   - ✅ Verify that there are no console errors related to the new component.

## Next Steps

1. Style the PromptManager component:
   - Add appropriate CSS to make the PromptManager consistent with the rest of the application's design.

2. Update documentation:
   - Add information about the new prompt management feature to the project documentation.

3. Create tests for PromptManager:
   - Develop unit tests for the PromptManager component.
   - Perform integration tests to ensure the prompt management feature works correctly with the rest of the application.

4. Implement prompt versioning and templates:
   - Extend the Prompt model to include version information.
   - Implement API endpoints for managing prompt versions.
   - Update the frontend to display and manage prompt versions.
   - Create a system for prompt templates that can be easily applied to new projects.

5. Enhance authentication and authorization:
   - Ensure that only authorized users can access and modify prompts for a given project.

6. Improve Log Utilization:
   - Develop a strategy for more effectively analyzing and using the logs generated in the terminal.
   - Implement a log parsing system to extract relevant information for debugging.

7. Improve State Management:
   - Review and optimize state management in the App component and its children.
   - Ensure that state updates are handled correctly, especially after API calls.

8. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed prompts.
   - Optimize database queries for prompt retrieval and management.

This file will be updated as we make progress on implementing the project-based prompt management feature and improving the overall functionality of the application.
