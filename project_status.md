# Open Interpreter Project Status

## Vision
The goal in modifying this program is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment. This allows users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis, primarily intended for open-source software. Our modifications prioritize the ability to reference specific documentation and customize prompts for each project. The program adheres to programming best practices rather than being creative.

### Completed Features

[... Previous completed features remain unchanged ...]

- Implemented API endpoints for getting projects, settings, and listing files
- Fixed "Failed to load configuration" error
- Successfully integrated frontend with backend API
- Implemented error boundary in the main App component

### In Progress

1. Testing Strategy:
   - Set up pytest testing framework
   - Created and successfully ran initial test files (test_basic.py and test_interpreter.py) with basic assertions
   - Implemented unit tests for core components of the OpenInterpreter class
   - Developed flexible tests that can adapt to changes in the class structure
   - Successfully ran all tests, with 5 passing and 1 skipped

2. Documentation:
   - Updating documentation to reflect new features and improvements

3. Frontend-Backend Integration:
   - Implemented API endpoints for getting projects, settings, and listing files
   - Added debug logging for API responses
   - Successfully resolved the "Failed to load configuration" error

## Current Focus
- Troubleshoot and resolve the issue causing the application screen to go white shortly after loading

## Current Issue
The application initially loads and displays the interface briefly, but then the entire screen goes white. This issue persists even after implementing an error boundary in the main App component. The server logs show successful responses to API requests, but no error messages are being logged. The cause of this behavior is currently unknown and requires further investigation.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate White Screen Issue:
   - Implement more detailed client-side logging
   - Check for any JavaScript errors that might be causing the application to crash
   - Verify that all necessary assets are being loaded correctly
   - Test the application in different browsers to see if the issue is browser-specific
   - Gradually remove components from the main App to isolate the cause of the problem

2. Enhance Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement more robust error handling in both frontend and backend
   - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options
   - Improve logging on both client and server side to capture more detailed information about the application's state

3. Expand Frontend Functionality:
   - Implement project creation and selection in the UI
   - Add file browsing and editing capabilities using the list_files API
   - Implement settings management in the frontend

4. Enhance Backend Functionality:
   - Implement project creation and deletion APIs
   - Add file manipulation APIs (create, edit, delete)
   - Implement user authentication and authorization

5. Expand Testing Strategy:
   - Create more comprehensive unit tests for all individual components (frontend and backend)
   - Implement integration tests for API and backend interactions
   - Set up end-to-end testing for critical user flows
   - Implement continuous integration to run tests automatically on code changes

6. Update Documentation:
   - Document new features and web interface usage
   - Update README with web interface instructions and setup process
   - Create user guide for the enhanced Open Interpreter

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Conduct performance audits on both frontend and backend
   - Optimize API calls and data loading strategies
   - Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate

8. Security Enhancements:
   - Conduct security audit of the application
   - Implement additional security measures (e.g., input sanitization, CSRF protection)

9. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Conduct accessibility audit
   - Implement improvements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

10. Internationalization:
    - Prepare the application for internationalization
    - Implement language selection feature

11. Conduct User Testing:
    - Organize user testing sessions
    - Gather feedback and implement improvements based on user input

12. Final Polish:
    - Address any remaining bugs or issues
    - Optimize application performance
    - Ensure consistent styling and user experience across all components
