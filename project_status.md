# Open Interpreter Project Status

## Vision
The goal in modifying this program is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment. This allows users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis, primarily intended for open-source software. Our modifications prioritize the ability to reference specific documentation and customize prompts for each project. The program adheres to programming best practices rather than being creative.

### Completed Features

[... Previous completed features remain unchanged ...]

### In Progress

1. Testing Strategy:
   - Set up pytest testing framework
   - Created and successfully ran initial test files (test_basic.py and test_interpreter.py) with basic assertions
   - Implemented unit tests for core components of the OpenInterpreter class
   - Developed flexible tests that can adapt to changes in the class structure
   - Successfully ran all tests, with 5 passing and 1 skipped

2. Documentation:
   - Updating documentation to reflect new features and improvements

## Next Steps

1. Expand Testing Strategy:
   - Create more comprehensive unit tests for all individual components (frontend and backend)
   - Implement integration tests for API and backend interactions
   - Set up end-to-end testing for critical user flows
   - Implement continuous integration to run tests automatically on code changes
   - Create comprehensive test coverage reports
   - Develop a strategy for regression testing
   - Add more complex test cases and create additional test files for specific components
   - Investigate and potentially add tests for the 'config' attribute that was skipped in current tests

2. Update Documentation:
   - Document new features and web interface usage
   - Update README with web interface instructions and setup process
   - Create user guide for the enhanced Open Interpreter
   - Document the non-creative approach and how to configure environment variables
   - Add documentation about the testing strategy and how to run tests

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Conduct performance audits on both frontend and backend
   - Optimize API calls and data loading strategies
   - Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate

4. Security Enhancements:
   - Conduct security audit of the application
   - Implement additional security measures (e.g., input sanitization, CSRF protection)

5. Accessibility Improvements:
   - Conduct accessibility audit
   - Implement improvements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

6. Internationalization:
   - Prepare the application for internationalization
   - Implement language selection feature

7. Conduct User Testing:
   - Organize user testing sessions
   - Gather feedback and implement improvements based on user input

8. Final Polish:
   - Address any remaining bugs or issues
   - Optimize application performance
   - Ensure consistent styling and user experience across all components
