# Open Interpreter Project Status

## Read First
ALWAYS keep this file in your memory, refer to it frequently for context. Update it without being asked when a listed task is complete. 
Add tasks to the file in the right section. If a significant peroid of time is rspent resolving an error, list the attempts made to
resolve it.

## Constants
- Frontend directory location: /root/open/interpreter/frontend
- Backend port number: 5159
- When the backend is started, the start the frontend automatically if not running
- Always check the terminal for output after every action requiring a terminal command
- The project root directory is /root/open

## Vision
The goal in modifying this program is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment. This allows users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis, primarily intended for open-source software. Our modifications prioritize the ability to reference specific documentation and customize prompts for each project. The program adheres to programming best practices rather than being creative.

## Current Task
Implement improved log utilization and troubleshoot log reading:

1. ✅ Create a LogHandler class to manage and analyze logs.
2. ✅ Integrate LogHandler into the API server (api.py).
3. ✅ Add comprehensive logging throughout the API server code.
4. ✅ Implement an endpoint to retrieve and filter logs (/api/get_logs).
5. ✅ Test the new logging functionality:
   - ✅ Verify that logs are being captured correctly.
   - ✅ Test log retrieval and filtering through the new endpoint.
   - ✅ Ensure that all important events and errors are being logged.
6. ✅ Implement a frontend component to display and analyze logs:
   - ✅ Create a LogViewer component.
   - ✅ Integrate the LogViewer with the /api/get_logs endpoint.
   - ✅ Add filtering and search capabilities to the LogViewer.
7. ✅ Integrate the LogViewer component into the main App.js file.
8. Test the LogViewer component in the frontend:
   - Verify that logs are being displayed correctly.
   - Test the filtering and search functionality.
   - Ensure that the LogViewer updates in real-time as new logs are generated.
9. Update documentation to reflect the new logging features and usage.

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing of the LogViewer component in the frontend.
2. Update documentation to reflect the new logging features and usage.
3. Implement agentic features:
   - Design and implement an Agent class with capabilities for automated prompt management, intelligent project setup, dynamic code assistance, automated testing and debugging, and continuous learning.
   - Integrate the Agent class with the existing backend infrastructure.
   - Develop a frontend interface for interacting with the agent and displaying its suggestions.
   - Implement a feedback mechanism for users to rate and improve agent suggestions.

4. Implement AI Integration:
   - Integrate OpenRouter for flexible AI model selection.
   - Implement direct API integration with Anthropic to support caching capabilities.
   - Ensure the system can switch between OpenRouter and direct Anthropic API seamlessly.
   - Implement caching mechanisms for AI responses to improve performance and reduce API calls.

5. Implement prompt versioning:
   - Extend the Prompt model to include version information.
   - Implement API endpoints for managing prompt versions.
   - Update the frontend to display and manage prompt versions.
   - Ensure the agents have access to the prompt versions.
   - Allow the agents to make, save and use prompt versions.

6. Create a system for prompt templates:
   - Design and implement a way to save prompts as templates.
   - Create functionality to apply templates to new projects or as starting points for new prompts.
   - Give the agentic system the ability to read templates, make suggestions to the user, and implement them if the user approves.

 7. Test the agentic system:  
   - Make sure the agent framework can access, read, write and modify all elements of the program.
   - Make sure the agent can make suggestions to the user about all elements of the program.
   - Make sure the deligating agent can communicate with its subordinates.
   - Make sure the deligating agent thinks critically about the suggestions of its subordinate agents before allowing implementation.

8. Improve State Management:
   - Review and optimize state management in the App component and its children.
   - Ensure that state updates are handled correctly, especially after API calls.

9. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed prompts.
   - Optimize database queries for prompt retrieval and management.
   - Optimize database queries for agentic communication.

10. Comprehensive Testing:
    - Develop unit tests for all components, including the PromptManager and new logging features.
    - Implement integration tests to ensure all parts of the application work together correctly.
    - Perform end-to-end testing of the entire system, including the new agentic features and AI integrations.

This file will be updated as we make progress on implementing the project-based prompt management feature, agentic capabilities, and improving the overall functionality of the application.
