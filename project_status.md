# Open Interpreter Project Status

## Vision
The goal in modifying this program is to create a React Frontend with a modular, project-based environment. This allows users to customize the program's functionality on a per-project basis, primarily intended for open-source software. Our modifications prioritize the ability to reference specific documentation and customize prompts for each project. The program adheres to programming best practices rather than being creative.

## Current Issues

1. White Screen Problem:
   - The application initially loads but then displays a white screen
   - Error message observed: "TypeError: e.endsWith is not a function"
   - Error occurs at:
     ```
     at eo (http://198.91.27.14:5159/static/js/main.983034d4.js:2:313445)

     at fo (http://198.91.27.14:5159/static/js/main.983034d4.js:2:329015)
     ```

2. Log Implementation:
   - Current implementation is not effectively utilizing the logs generated in the terminal
   - Need to improve the way logs are analyzed and used for debugging

3. API Endpoint Mismatches:
   - Some API calls are returning 404 errors, specifically:
     - GET /api/get_settings/get_settings
     - GET /api/get_settings/get_projects

## Next Steps

1. Debug White Screen Issue:
   - Investigate the `endsWith` error in the FileBrowser component
   - Review the minified JavaScript file to identify the source of the error
   - Implement additional error handling in the FileBrowser component

2. Improve Log Utilization:
   - Develop a strategy for more effectively analyzing and using the logs generated in the terminal
   - Implement a log parsing system to extract relevant information for debugging

3. Fix API Endpoint Mismatches:
   - Review and correct API endpoint URLs in the frontend code
   - Ensure backend routes match the frontend expectations

4. Enhance Error Handling:
   - Implement more robust error handling in individual components
   - Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options

5. Improve State Management:
   - Review and optimize state management in the App component and its children
   - Ensure that state updates are handled correctly, especially after API calls

6. Testing:
   - Develop unit tests for React components, focusing on the FileBrowser component
   - Implement integration tests for API and backend interactions

7. Documentation:
   - Update API documentation to reflect any changes made
   - Document the current issues and their potential causes for future reference

This file will be updated as we make progress on resolving the current issues and improving the overall stability and functionality of the application.
