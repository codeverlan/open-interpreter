# OpenRouter Integration

## Research Notes

1. OpenRouter API Overview:
   - OpenRouter is a unified API that provides access to various AI models, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others.
   - It allows for easy switching between different AI models without changing the code.

2. API Endpoint:
   - Base URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

3. Authentication:
   - Requires an API key for authentication.
   - The API key should be included in the request headers as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.

4. Main Endpoints:
   - `/chat/completions`: For chat-based completions
   - `/completions`: For text completions

5. Request Format:
   - POST request with JSON body
   - Key parameters:
     - `model`: Specifies which AI model to use
     - `messages`: Array of message objects for chat completions
     - `prompt`: String for text completions

6. Response Format:
   - JSON response containing the AI-generated content

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up OpenRouter API key:
   - Store the API key securely (use environment variables or a secure key management system)

2. Create an OpenRouterClient class:
   - Implement methods for chat completions and text completions
   - Handle authentication and request formatting

3. Integrate OpenRouterClient with our existing Agent class:
   - Allow agents to use OpenRouter for AI-powered responses
   - Implement model selection functionality

4. Update the backend API:
   - Add endpoints for model selection and AI interactions

5. Implement error handling and fallbacks:
   - Handle API errors gracefully
   - Implement fallback options if OpenRouter is unavailable

6. Add caching mechanism:
   - Implement a caching system to store and reuse frequent AI responses

7. Update the frontend:
   - Add UI elements for model selection
   - Display AI-generated responses in the chat interface

## Next Steps

1. Set up OpenRouter account and obtain API key
2. Implement OpenRouterClient class
3. Update Agent class to use OpenRouterClient
4. Create new API endpoints for AI interactions
5. Implement error handling and caching
6. Update frontend to support model selection and display AI responses
